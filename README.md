# Used to jumpstart color themes for new projects

Used **Vite** to create a typescript React app.

Installed and set up **React Router v6.4** with two routes (Home/Root and About).

Installed and applied **React Bootstrap 5**.

Added a responsive Navigation Bar component.

Root component has various elements that will be impacted by the change of theme color.
